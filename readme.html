  						<h2>About Portal</h2>
              <p>Portal was developed to provide easy access to regularly used tools. It has grown over the past couple of years from a small toolset, to a potentially company-wide intranet site.</p>

              <h2>Pages</h2>
              Portal contains three groups of pages: landing, internal, and external.</p>
              <p>Landing pages are department specific.</p>
              <p>Internal pages may be restricted by department, and will not show if the logged in user does not have the proper permissions level. These pages contain tools that are useful to the assigned departments, but are not included in the departmental landing page.</p>
              <p>External pages are any common tools or applications that are not a part of Portal. These will have menu links, in either the top menu or sidebar, but will open in a new tab. These menu options can be updated within the Admin page, and are maintained in the site's database.</p>
